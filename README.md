Personal Income Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This Python program classifies individuals into income brackets (<= $50,000 or > $50,000) based on a provided dataset (income.csv) using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The script performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, and KNN modeling with hyperparameter tuning.

Key functionalities of the script:

    Data Loading and Preprocessing:
        1.Reads the CSV file using pandas.
        2.Handles missing values by considering " ?" as NaN during data import.
        3.Drops rows with missing values using .dropna(axis=0).

    Data Preprocessing:
        1.Analyzes missing value patterns (not explicitly shown in this code).

    Feature Engineering:
        1.Encodes categorical variables using one-hot encoding (pd.get_dummies).

    KNN Modeling:
        1.Splits the data into training and testing sets.
        2.Trains a KNN classifier with an initial n_neighbors value of 5.
        3.Evaluates the model performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and misclassified samples.
        4.Explores the effect of the n_neighbors parameter on classification accuracy by trying different values between 1 and 20 (not used for final model selection).

Outputs:

    1.The program prints the confusion matrix, accuracy score, and number of misclassified samples for the KNN model with n_neighbors = 5.
    2.It also prints a list showing the number of misclassified samples for KNN models with n_neighbors ranging from 1 to 20 (for hyperparameter tuning exploration).

Note:

    1.This script assumes the required libraries (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn) are installed.
    2.The CSV file containing the income data (income.csv) needs to be placed in the same directory as the script.
    3.The script provides a starting point for KNN classification. You can further improve the model by:
        I)Experimenting with different values for n_neighbors to find the optimal value.
        II)Trying other distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance) within the KNN classifier.
        II)Performing feature scaling or normalization if necessary.
